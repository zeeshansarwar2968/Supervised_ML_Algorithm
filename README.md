### Regression

> Simple Linear Regression
[1.] Build a predictive linear regression model for given dataset, train the model for training set and test it against test dataset, plot the model using any plotting library. \

[2.] Build a predictive linear regression model for given dataset, given humidity predict apparent temperature \

> Multiple Linear Regression
[1.] Build a predictive linear regression model for given dataset, given temperature,humidity, wind speed , wind bearing, visibility, pressure predict apparent temperature  \

### Classification

> Logistic Regression
[1.] The data given in the url is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more
than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. Build a model to
predict whether client will subscribe to term deposit   \

[2.] Build a machine learning model to predict whether a person makes over 50K a year or not    \

### K- Nearest Neighbor (KNN)

[1.] The data given in the url is related with direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more
than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) would be ('yes') or not ('no') subscribed. Build a model to
predict whether client will subscribe to term deposit   \
